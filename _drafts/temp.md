We've been learning about complex networks and the applications of network science. One application we've looked at has been in healthcare, specifically the early detection of epidemics using social networks. 

After watching ['How Social Networks Predict Epidemics'](https://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_christakis_how_social_networks_predict_epidemics) and reading ['Social Network Sensors for Early Detection of Contagious Outbreaks'](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012948) and Oliver Burkeman's Guardian column on the ['friendship paradox'](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jan/30/change-your-life-friends-popular) we got together in a tutorial to talk it through.

It's interesting stuff. The basic idea is this:

* certain individuals who are more central in a social network (i.e a set of individuals who have some relationship to others within the set) are more likely to be infected early during an epidemic.
* if we could ascertain who these individuals are early, we would 
* mapping a whole network in order to establish who these individuals are is very difficult.


>if we want to track something that was spreading through a network, what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network ... monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network, and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network.
