I've been reading ['To Predict and Serve'](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x/full) by Kristian Lum and William Isaac. It's an interesting article describing the issues around the use of big data 

aim - to stop crime before it occurs

issues 

* lack of transparency around how the predictive models work
* how the data is being used
* systematic bias being embedded in the models 
	*	consequences -over-policing of already heavily policed communities
*
