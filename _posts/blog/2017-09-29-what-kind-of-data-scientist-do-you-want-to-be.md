During an introductory [What Is Data Science?](http://quarter.cs.stir.ac.uk/courses/ITNPBD4/lectures/1-What%20is%20Data%20Science.pdf) lecture at the start of my course, one of the questions that was raised was '_What are the skills that a data scientist needs?_' (It was also a question posed by [Mark Hunter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjhunter/) and [Sandy Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-scott-2912813/) of [Sainsbury's Bank](https://www.sainsburysbank.co.uk/) at the [Data Scientist 2.0 event](http://www.datascientist2-0.com) two weeks ago.)

## What skills do data scientists need?

The potential list is huge, comprising skills across maths/statistics, programming, databases, domain expertise, soft skills, communication and visualisation. 

My first reaction was the thought, _'How am I supposed to get good at all that stuff in the next twelve months?'_

My second thought was, _'How can **anyone** be good at all that, no matter how long they've got to learn it?'_ 


Of course, no one can. 

It's all about the skills in the _team_ rather than the individual. (A brief aside: what percentage of data scientists actually work in a team of other data scientists, and how many work alone?).

This got me thinking:

* how do my existing skills fit with the skills required of a data scientist?
* what skills do I need to develop more?
* what kind of data scientist do I think I could be? 
* What would be a good fit for my skills, values and interests?
* what kind of data scientist do I _want_ to be?

## What kind of data scientist might I be?


Harlan Harris, one of the organisers of [Data Community DC](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/), in Washington D.C, surveyed a group of data scientists about how they viewed their own skills, described in ['Analysing the Analysers'](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/analyzing-the-analyzers).

The chart below shows how the data scientist self-identify. This chart was shown to us during our lecture, and of course my first thought was _'Which one am I?'_

The one I feel is the best fit for me is that of **Data Creative**. Of course, I've got the next year to figure out what's the best fit for me, but at the moment this is my best guess. 

##Why Data Creative?

Well, first off, I think of myself of a creative person. I'm interested in solving problems, specifically problems that impact on people's lives (rather than esoteric, abstract problems - I don't give a hoot about those). I'm the kind of person that asks, _'How could we make this better?'_ I want to use data science to help people improve their lives. I want to use data as a force for good. That takes creativity.

Secondly, the role of Data Creative (as described here at least) is a balanced one, requiring a range of skills, but where no single skill dominates. 

Thirdly, I like the amount of programming that's shown within this category. I enjoy coding. It's a great tool. However, I'm never going to be the most techie guy in the room, nor would I want to be. And I certainly wouldn't want most of my work-life to be spent coding. That's just not for me. That said, one skill-set I have that I believe could be useful is that of software engineering, and managing software engineering projects. I've managed the delivery of software products before and could foresee myself playing a useful role in delivering data products.

There are, however, a couple of aspects of the Data Creative I'd change to to fit my personal skills. The 'Business' skills section I would make bigger. I can relate well to business people and can speak in their language. Through talking to some people in data science recruitment, this appears to be a skill that's not always evident in data science candidates. 

Additionally, two vital skills for data scientists aren't shown in the chart at all, namely _communication_ and _visualisation_. I believe I'm a strong communicator. Visualisation (as far as data science goes) is the art of making the complex understandable. I'm sure I've got lots to learn here, but communicating with stakeholders/clients/colleagues (including communcating results) is fundamental to the art and science of creating actionable insights from data, and a skill I look forward to developing further.

What kind of data scientist are you? What kind do you _want_ to be?
