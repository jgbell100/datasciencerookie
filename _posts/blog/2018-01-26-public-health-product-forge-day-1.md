The first day of [Product Forge's Public Health hackathon](https://productforge.io/events/public-health-product-forge/) is over. Yesterday was all about setting the scene around the current state of public health in Scotland (with speakers from [Scottish Health Innovation Ltd](https://www.shil.co.uk/), [NHS Information Services Division](http://www.isdscotland.org/), [statistics.gov.scot](http://statistics.gov.scot/) amongst others), networking and team formation.

Oh, and haggis too. It was Burns Night after all.

It's not a pretty picture - we've got so many pressing health issues here in Scotland. On the positive side however, there are so many things being done on a number of fronts to address these issues. And the fact that so many people have turned up to this event on a cold January night in Edinburgh in testament to the fact that are many people who want to improve public health.

The challenge this weekend will be to explore how technology and data can be used to improve public health in Scotland. A challenge indeed.

I love the interdisciplinary nature of events like this and the diversity of people who participate. Last night I had the chance to meet a computational biophysicist (I didn't know there was such a thing), a psychologist, medical students, an ex-A&E consultant-turned-entrepreneur, a PhD student in medical informatics and a systems engineer who has founded a CIC to support people with dementia live independently.


And that was just the first hour.

Day two begins...ideas...innovation...more ideas.
